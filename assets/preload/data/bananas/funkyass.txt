:bf:Beeb bab bob skdu?
:dad13:I've never been challenged to a rap battle before,so i don't know how things go
:dad14:but I thought it was necessary to start with something easy. 
:bf:Bab bee bop?
:dad15:oh nah, none of my friends sing much, same reason I got a little rusty on this. 
:dad16:Racing is fun.. but it stops being fun when Baby Mario constantly bonks into a mountain to skip 90% of Mushroom Gorge..
:dad17:Or when luigi bounces off a pipe to literally save himself a lap at wario's gold mine..
:bf:bap..??
:dad18:Don't worry if you don't understand, many don't. Very strange things happen here! Daisy knows what I'm talking about.
